The intention of the project is to create predictions bsaed off of the enemy
team's history. First, try to do this for one person. Let's say we collect the 
following data:
- 10 highest mastery champs
- ranked solo queue history
    - what roles are they playing
    - how well are they performing on certain champs, especially mastery ones
    - how long has it been since they played their highest mastery champ

- Rank best champs in the role
    - given tier
        - collect winrate data
        - collect pick rate
        - collect ban rate (maybe)
        - rank champs using some kind of algorithm
            - how to we incorporate these 3 factors? weighting? some complex math
            thing?

        - try to get maybe wins/pick?
            - winrate = wins/times champ picked
            - pickrate = times champs picked/total games
            - normalize bsaed on mastery points, average mastery points
                - logarithmic scale

- If you were banning against them, what are your top 3 bans?
    - What would restrict them the most/
    - 

TP0 Checkin Todo:
    -Determine Basic Process:
        -first find a the players in a given rank in ranked solo with:
         entries(region: str, queue: str, tier: str, division: str, page: int = 1)
        -loop through each player, getting summoner ID
            -for each summoner id, loope through champion specific match history
                -calculate WR for summoner on champ
        -average WR
        -multipy by (champ dificulty)/(max champ difficulty) for simple 'prio'

        -do as above but for only one player
        -give both number, give also one over the other, shows relative scale
        -order by 0.75*league 'prio' + 0.25*personal 'prio'
        -note if games < 5 on given champ

    -UI
        -basic entry box, enter summoner name
        -first case only has the prio rankings
        -return champ icons with the  weighted order, largest on left
        -return gathered metrics, winrate, games played for each champ
        -return league wide power rankings
